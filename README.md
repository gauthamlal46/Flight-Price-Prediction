# Flight Price Prediction

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Thatâ€™s why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain. 

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a predictive model which will help the customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.
